# My Google Colab Projects Collection

Welcome to my repository! This is a curated collection of my Google Colab projects. Each project is designed to be interactive, easy to follow, and educational, as almost every line is explained with as much detail as I can.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to any of the projects. If you find them useful, don't forget to give them a ‚≠ê!

## üìÇ Projects Overview

---

#### **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Random and Hard Modes)**
- **Description**: A Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI with two difficulty levels: **Random** and **Hard**. The hard mode uses a custom algorithm to ensure the "AI" always makes a winning move (if possible).
- **Colab Link**: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/your-link-here)
- **Technologies Used**: Python
- **Key Features**:
  - **Two "AI" Difficulty Levels**:
    - **Random Mode**: The "AI" makes random valid moves, making it easier to win.
    - **Hard Mode**: The AI uses an algorithm to always make a winning move, making it hard but possible.
  - **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against the "AI" in a simple, text-based interface.
  - **Customizable Board**: The game board is displayed in the console, and players can input their moves using coordinates.
- **How to Play**:
  1. Choose the difficulty level (Random or Hard).
  2. Enter your move by specifying the row and column (e.g., `A 1` for the top-left corner).
  3. The AI will respond with its move.
  4. The game continues until there's a winner or a draw.
- **Dataset Used**: N/A (No external dataset required for this project).
