## üìÇ Projects Overview

#### **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Random and Hard Modes)**
- **Description**: A Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against an AI with two difficulty levels: **Random** and **Hard**. The hard mode uses a custom algorithm to ensure the "AI" always makes a winning move (if possible).
- **Colab Link**: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/your-link-here)
- **Technologies Used**: Python
- **Key Features**:
  - **Two "AI" Difficulty Levels**:
    - **Random Mode**: The "AI" makes random valid moves, making it easier to win.
    - **Hard Mode**: The AI uses an algorithm to always make a winning move, making it hard but possible.
  - **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against the "AI" in a simple, text-based interface.
  - **Customizable Board**: The game board is displayed in the console, and players can input their moves using coordinates.
- **How to Play**:
  1. Choose the difficulty level (Random or Hard).
  2. Enter your move by specifying the row and column (e.g., `A 1` for the top-left corner).
  3. The AI will respond with its move.
  4. The game continues until there's a winner or a draw.
- **Dataset Used**: N/A (No external dataset required for this project).

### **Apidex - A Minimalist Pokedex**
- **Description**: A simple Python project that fetches and displays Pok√©mon data using the PokeAPI. It‚Äôs designed as a learning tool for working with APIs and handling JSON data.
- **Colab Link**: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/NE0BIT/pokedex/blob/main/pokedex.ipynb" target="_blank"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/> </a>
- **Technologies Used**: Python, PokeAPI
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetches Pok√©mon data (name, ID, type, abilities) from the PokeAPI.
  - Simple and interactive: Enter a Pok√©mon name or ID to get details.
  - Minimalist design, perfect for beginners to understand and modify.
- **How to Use**:
  1. Open the Colab notebook using the provided link.
  2. Run all the cells to initialize the script.
  3. When prompted, enter the name or ID of the Pok√©mon you want to search for.
  4. View the Pok√©mon details displayed in the output.
- **Dataset Used**: [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
